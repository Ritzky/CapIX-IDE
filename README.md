## What's in the box?

Capix IDE is a full VS Code-compatible editor with a Capix-branded sidebar extension that includes:

### LLM Deploy + Management
- **Model Catalog** — browse featured partner + community models; click to deploy on a GPU
- **Deploy custom models** — paste a Hugging Face link; we auto-detect the GPU specs (VRAM, params, context)
- **My Deploys** — live status of your running/stopped/provisioning deploys
- **Destroy / Stop / Start** — full GPU instance lifecycle with confirmation dialogs
- **View logs** — fetch vLLM boot + server logs to see why a deploy hasn't gone live
- **Run command on GPU** — execute `nvidia-smi`, `docker ps`, `docker logs` on the instance for debugging (command allowlist enforced)
- **Copy endpoint / API key** — one click to copy the OpenAI base URL + Bearer key
- **Region selection** — deploy to Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, or Global

### Cloud Panels (all synced with the web console)
- **Instances** — list VPS / GPU / LLM deploys with start/stop/destroy/SSH controls
- **Agents** — list GitHub repo deploys with view logs / open terminal
- **Serverless Jobs** — list + trigger capix-job.yml jobs
- **API Keys** — create / revoke `cpk_` keys for the OpenAI-compatible chat gateway

### Profile (synced across web + IDE)
- **Wallet balance** — USD + SOL + USDC equivalents, with active billing per-deploy ($/hr + $/min)
- **Top up** — SOL, USDC (Solana), or USDC on Base (EVM tx-hash verify)
- **Total spent** — lifetime billing history

### Native SSH Terminal
- Click "Open Terminal" on any instance/agent/job → opens a real VS Code integrated terminal pre-configured with SSH
- Reuses existing terminals for the same host
- Run commands directly on your deployed GPU instances

### Auto-Connect LLM
- When an LLM deploy becomes ready (in the IDE or on capix.network), the chat provider is auto-configured with the base URL + API key
- Checks for existing ready deploys on startup — if any exist, auto-configures from the most recent one
- API key stored in VS Code SecretStorage (OS keychain), never in plaintext

### Profile Sync
- Same session token = shared balance, deploys, instances across the web console and the IDE
- Deploy on the web → shows up in the IDE instantly. Deploy in the IDE → visible on the web.
- Connect once with your `cpx_session.…` token — everything syncs.

### Dev Tokens (proof-of-development)
- Capix IDE automatically mints **DEV tokens** to your wallet when verifiable development happens:
  - Commit code with Capix Code → 1 DEV
  - Deploy an app/agent/LLM → 5 DEV
  - Complete a productive session (50+ turns) → 10 DEV
  - Record an architectural decision in Covenant → 2 DEV
  - Ship a complete product → 50 DEV
- Tokens are on-chain proof of useful work (Solana devnet pre-mainnet)
- In the future, DEV tokens will be exchangeable for SOL or CPX
- Visible in the Profile panel alongside your wallet balance

### Covenant (memory + governance + spirit)
- **Spirit** — a system prompt with behavioral guidelines + hard governance rules (no destructive actions without approval, always explain changes, match existing style)
- **Memory** — persistent store of decisions/patterns/feedback/context, injected into the system prompt before every chat call
- **Governance** — enforced client-side: never delete files without asking, never commit without approval, warn before breaking changes
- Editable `.capix/covenant.md` file for custom personality/rules
- Commands: Edit Covenant, Remember, Clear Memory

### Capix Code (CLI assistant) Integration
- "Capix: Launch Capix Code" command opens a terminal with `capix-code` pre-configured (env vars from SecretStorage)
- Falls back to the Capix gateway if no deployed LLM is configured
- `capix-code` is the Capix CLI coding assistant — [github.com/Ritzky/capix-code](https://github.com/Ritzky/capix-code)

### Settings Import
- **VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf** — copies `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, and extensions on first launch
- **JetBrains** — translates IntelliJ / PyCharm / WebStorm keymaps and color schemes into VS Code format

### Other
- **Capix logo + branding** — the activity bar icon is the real Capix brand mark, the status bar shows connection state, the sidebar is titled "Capix"
- **Extension marketplace** — uses [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org) (license-clean)
- **Cross-platform** — `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage via GitHub Actions
- **Security** — session tokens + API keys in VS Code SecretStorage (OS keychain), webview CSP with per-render nonce, SSH command allowlist, host-key pinning

## Quick start (users)

1. Download the installer for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/Ritzky/CapIX-IDE/releases).
2. On first launch, Capix IDE asks: "Import from VS Code / JetBrains?" — pick one to pull in your themes, keybindings, and extensions.
3. Run **Capix: Connect Wallet** (Command Palette) and paste your `cpx_session.…` token from capix.network.
4. Your profile, deploys, and instances sync automatically.
5. Deploy an LLM from the Model Catalog → when ready, the chat panel auto-configures.
6. Or launch `capix-code` in the terminal via **Capix: Launch Capix Code**.

See [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough.

## For developers — building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritzky/CapIX-IDE.git
cd CapixIDE
./scripts/bootstrap.sh   # clones the source + applies the Capix branding + installs the extension
./scripts/dev.sh         # launches the dev build
```

This repo is the **brand kit + extension + builder pipeline**. The full source lives in `vscode/` after `bootstrap.sh` clones it.

To package distributable installers:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh       # builds the app for your current platform
npx electron-builder --mac --arm64 --config electron-builder.yml
```

For CI/cross-platform release builds, tag a version and the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds all 6 platform/arch combos in parallel.
